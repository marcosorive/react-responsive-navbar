# React responsive navbar

This is a responsive Navbar component for React that I'm working on.
In screens with more than 600px it displays a regular navbar. In smaller screens, a menu icon is displayed and it opens a menu that covers the screen.

## How to use

[WIP]
Import the component and put it inside a Router from react-router-dom.

## Props list

* backgroundColor (default: black)
* fontcolor (default: white)
* brand (default: "Navbar")
* links (default: "Home" to /, "Portfolio" to /portfolio and "Blog" to /blog)
